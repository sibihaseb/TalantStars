# Troubleshooting Guide - Common Issues and Solutions

## GitHub Upload Issues

### Problem: "File too large" error
**Solution**: 
- Remove `node_modules` folder before uploading
- Only upload source code files, not dependencies

### Problem: Can't find files after extraction
**Solution**:
- Make sure you extracted the ZIP completely
- Look inside the extracted folder for files like `package.json`, `client`, `server`

### Problem: Upload keeps failing
**Solution**:
- Try uploading files in smaller batches
- Check your internet connection
- Try using GitHub Desktop instead

## Vercel Deployment Issues

### Problem: Build fails with "npm install" error
**Solution**:
1. Check that `package.json` file was uploaded to GitHub
2. Go to Vercel Settings â†’ General â†’ Node.js Version â†’ Set to 18.x

### Problem: Build fails with "command not found"
**Solution**:
- Make sure Build Command is exactly: `npm run build`
- Make sure Output Directory is exactly: `dist`

### Problem: App shows "404 Not Found"
**Solution**:
- Check that Output Directory is set to `dist`
- Redeploy after fixing settings

### Problem: App loads but shows errors
**Solution**:
- Check that all 6 environment variables are set
- Make sure variable names are spelled exactly right
- Redeploy after adding all variables

## Environment Variables Issues

### Problem: Database connection error
**Solutions**:
- Double-check DATABASE_URL format
- Make sure password in URL matches your Supabase password
- Test connection in Supabase SQL Editor: `SELECT 1;`

### Problem: Stripe not working
**Solutions**:
- Verify you have both secret key (sk_) and public key (pk_)
- Make sure keys are from the same Stripe account
- Check that keys aren't expired

### Problem: Email not sending
**Solutions**:
- Verify Resend API key starts with `re_`
- Check Resend dashboard for any sending issues
- Make sure domain is verified in Resend

### Problem: App crashes on startup
**Solutions**:
- Check all 6 environment variables are present
- Look at Vercel Functions logs for specific errors
- Make sure SESSION_SECRET is at least 16 characters

## Getting Help

### Where to Find Logs
1. **Vercel**: Project â†’ Functions â†’ Click on function â†’ View logs
2. **Supabase**: Project â†’ Logs â†’ Database logs
3. **Browser**: Right-click â†’ Inspect â†’ Console tab

### Testing Individual Components
- **Database**: Run `SELECT 1;` in Supabase SQL Editor
- **Stripe**: Visit Stripe dashboard â†’ Logs
- **Email**: Send test email from Resend dashboard

### If All Else Fails
1. Try redeploying: Vercel â†’ Deployments â†’ Redeploy
2. Check that all files uploaded correctly to GitHub
3. Verify all environment variables are exactly as specified
4. Compare your setup with the working Replit version

## Success Indicators

### âœ… Everything Working Correctly:
- GitHub shows all your project files
- Vercel deployment shows "Ready"
- Your .vercel.app URL loads the landing page
- User registration creates accounts
- Login works with created accounts
- Profile creation saves properly

### ðŸ”„ Normal Warnings (Safe to Ignore):
- "Browserslist data is old" - cosmetic warning
- Build warnings about unused variables - won't break functionality
- Some TypeScript warnings - app will still work

Your platform should work exactly like it did on Replit, but now it's on professional, scalable hosting!
